## Entry Format

Add newest entries first. Include date, roadmap IDs, branch/commit when known,
completed work, verification, open risks, and the next action. Never record
secrets, tokens, private prompts, or customer data.

## 2026-09-30 — Harness Audit and Roadmap Controls

**Roadmap IDs:** R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8
**Branch/base commit:** `codex/adapter-driven-runtime`, based on `0d04d0f`

- Recorded the audited baseline: reasoning 5/10, reflection 3/10, autonomous
  delivery 3/10, user memory 5/10, and recovery 7/10.
- Established the authoritative roadmap, current plan, and this persistent log.
  The immediate sequence is R1 proposal approval → apply → verify → resume,
  isolated worktrees/project-aware validation, then the unified event/outbox and
  typed intake contract.
- Branch inspection reported the CI fix commit with tests and `go vet` passing.
  No merge or push was performed in this session.

**Open risks:** proposal approval is not connected to durable apply/resume;
graph and NATS event stacks are split; local delegation needs reliable terminal
acknowledgement; Recall reliability/idempotency remains a dependency.

**Next action:** design and implement R1's approval identity and application
boundary, then prove it through the R1 verification scenarios in the current
plan.
